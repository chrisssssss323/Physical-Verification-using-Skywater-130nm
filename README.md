VSD-IAT WS - Physical Verification using SKY130
SKY130 workshop documentation

##LAB 1

Created symbolic links between various files for the project ‘inverter’

xschem - Schematic of various components can be found and it can be clicked upon to view everything!

1.Shift-I to insert stuff

2.Hover+M for moving

3.Hover+W for wiring

4.Mouse 1 + q for props

5.After properly making the schematic, save it to a symbol and run a working test-bench with the various components.

6.Net-list +  Simulate

7.Go back, turn LVS option on on original and quit.

Magic -  Upon properly setting up, we can find the technology used as SKY130 and various layers of the technology!

1.magic -d XR - Better 3D rendering for symbols.

2.magic -d OGL - Faster

	Mouse 1- For placing
	Mouse 3 - For resizing
  
I -selecting a component

S-Select 
	%what - check component specs
  
	(Moving is different than xschem, move to lower left hand corner and click M after using I)
(Ctrl+p for param)

After joining the layouts, extract and perform lvs on the command line. If properly done, the netlists will be matched!





##LAB 2
Standard start, created a directory for the lab, a directory for the mag file and loaded contents into it.

Read gds files into the magic tkcon terminal and loaded it.

	cif istyle sky130 (vendor)
	gds ..
	gds noduplicates true (to avoid rewriting the file)
  
Using cell manager, we see the components in the scroll list.

Placed an AND2_1 gate

Analysing various aspects of ports

port first

port 1 name,class,use (spits out default (GDS is bad at taking in metadata. But some order must be there to these ports, to analyze them))

When we look into various aspects of the ports, we see that the .spice file has the ordering completely different to that of the gds.

We use the lef command to solve this problem!
		https://teamvlsi.com/2020/05/lef-lef-file-in-asic-design.html
		Lef files are associated with placement and routing, therefore we won’t find any transistors present in this particular view. (Abstract view)
    
Now, we get proper annotation for different ports but still the .spice is not matched with the port ordering.

So, we run the readspice from within the console and match orderings!

This is really useful but might sometimes lead to errors due to abstract views.
